## lab 5 - CapSense library

got it to work after a series of tedious debugging (apparently it doesn't work when the laptop is not charging!)
noticed a weird quirk with the measurement; it goes negative when I touch my laptop

decided to send the serial data to processing and make a processing sketch that displays a face depending on whether the computer is touched or not
