## playing with fades

The task for this exercise was to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to create a [fading LED](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Fade) effect.
The final version of the soldered board:

And here you can see a [video of the working circuit](https://photos.app.goo.gl/cTGLG6gLgEbxG7CdA).

## measuring a the voltage of a voltage divider

Even though it wasn't required, here's a [video of us measuring the voltage](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EDT3XseBgZxmbN7m8) of in a circuit with a voltage divider.

## dark detecting LED

The last exercise was using Phototransistors to create an LED that lights up if the brightness levels fall under a certain threshold. The video of the final result for this exercise:
