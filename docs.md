# week one documentation

- first day: made the exercises 1 + 2 (light LED and press button)
- created wiring for a simon says game:
  - one reset circuit connected to input pin (to restart the game)
  - three LEDs with parallel circuit which can be either activated by an output pin or button press
  - connect that to three input pins that detect when LEDs are on

once that was created, the rest was software!

## lessons learned

- don't short circuit your arduino
- don't forget to use resistors (did that one way too often...)
